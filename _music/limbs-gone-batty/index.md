## Note

Why, but why this title? Gil's sister Dorit wrote a masters thesis with this title. We thought it deserved the attention of popular music lovers from Osaka to Otjiwarongo. More bat for your buck over at the paper: _[A second wave of Sonic hedgehog expression during the development of the bat limb](http://www.pnas.org/content/105/44/16982.abstract)_.
