here we go for the very last time even though we don’t know it it’s the very last time here we go for the very last time even though we don’t know it it’s the very last time you leave the house first I follow behind our love stays behind in the house by itself every beautiful memory every postcard sent the plants and the clothes the things we have shared I’ll remember you every day of my life a flower is a thing you can cut with a knife here we go for the very last time even though we don’t know it it’s the very last time we never knew there was a train on the tracks the only thing we heard was our hearts on the rack now I can’t sleep without retracing my tracks going back to the house, and locking us in with the love I have left I could resurrect hoist a sail to the mast and never look back here we go for the very last time even though we don’t know it it’s the very last time I hold your hand I open the door I start the car and off we go here we go for the very last time even though we don’t know it it’s the very last time I remember every fragrant thing the movements, magic, the fun within we could stop and hold a moment here dip our feet in the sea and never look back here we go for the very last time even though we don’t know it it’s the very last time here we go for the

very last time even though we don’t know it it’s the very last time
