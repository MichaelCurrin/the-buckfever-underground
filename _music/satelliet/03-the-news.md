title: The News

There is unease in the air, not far from here<br>
at times, shots ring out – I am not sure:<br>
is it that, or just a car? or is it just me, do I hear<br>
that now, in everything, like I hear it too,<br>
in my dreams, I imagine intruders, a window sliding open,<br>
a shadow looms over me, I wake, there is nothing but the night.<br>

In the morning, the news drifts into our lives:<br>
a retweeted tweet, a WhatsApp from an aunt:<br>
They have found a vaccine! Eat garlic! Drink hot water!<br>
Alice shows me a funny meme, but I don’t know what it means.<br>

I click on a website: They know I’m there, as I search the site<br>
for important events, someone is collecting my data<br>
so there’s a readymade advertisement waiting for me<br>
next time, knowing I’ve been muttering about Mahindra<br>
bakkies, or getting a new Samsung, or simply Cadbury’s,<br>
or that I’ve just forgotten to brush my teeth.<br>

Driving in my car, seeing the world approach my<br>
window with outstretched hands,<br>
I accidentally touch my lips, I wonder:<br>
The virus, what have I been holding?<br>
I squirt soap into my hands, when the lights are red<br>
I even keep it in the car – aren’t the lights red for longer these days?<br>
I think about all the new types of plastic, the facemasks<br>
in the sea, the see-saw of history, standing in the balance<br>
waiting like a tennis ball suspended in the air by<br>
accidentally pressing pause on reality’s quarter finals.<br>

A community radio presenter stumbles over<br>
the words, and I cannot blame her,<br>
I am surprised she gets anything out at all.<br>

It amazes me how slick – even beautiful (I have a<br>
favourite newsreader on Al Jazeera, do you?) – it sometimes<br>
seems on the news networks, how fine their hair,<br>
how chiselled the cheekbones, and how brief the footnote<br>
of another attack somewhere in Chad.<br>

There’s no footage from there, no smart phones were present<br>
(Unlike when the shed full of fertilizer exploded in Beirut)<br>
and by the time the authorities reach the site,<br>
at the edge of a lake, where fishermen lived in makeshift<br>
huts made from reeds and mud, the bodies are puffed up,<br>
a layer of dust has collected over what has been the news,<br>
and the Boko Haram has disappeared into the desert:<br>
The djinns of their own destiny.<br>
