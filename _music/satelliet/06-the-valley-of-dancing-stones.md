title: The Valley of Dancing Stones
---

in the sky the birds seed song along flight-paths narrow and strong<br>
I creak along a thought from where I sit, old, and wooden, and still<br>
the fynbos on the slopes, the sea out on the bay<br>
the snow-sown mountain tops, the quartzite plains below<br>
all held here in my cup, coffee beans to my lip<br>
meat-bone and orange rind, bubbling water from a tap<br>
softening my skin, sand-papered in the wind<br>
of time and talk, and being-with and being-me<br>
we are not alone and we have wings, we have tongues and we can sing<br>
we carry visions, we hold dreams, when we sleep<br>
plate tectonics ensure that we drift apart, yet are crumpled together like a sponge<br>
the Himalayas rise higher, and reach around to touch fingers<br>
with our faraway friends, a flock around a fire<br>
hold strong, up ahead, keep the course, don’t stray<br>
roll up your bag in the morning, shoulder a load<br>
and go forth: the sun sits at your back<br>
nudging you along, through the valley of dancing stones<br>
along the streams of bitter-sweet remember<br>
the light flickering in everything<br>
to see you, to see you<br>

bitter-sweet remember<br>
bitter-sweet remember<br>
bitter-sweet remember _(repeat)_<br>

hold strong, up ahead, keep the course, don’t stray<br>
roll up your bag in the morning, shoulder a load<br>
and go forth:<br>

through the valley of dancing stones<br>
along the streams of bitter-sweet remember<br>
the light flickering in everything<br>
to see you, to see you<br>
