title: Walk fast, whistle
---

walk fast, whistle<br>
cock your ears and listen<br>
hold your line<br>
hold your own<br>
wind the window down<br>
tap the beat on the wheel<br>
look up, greet<br>
touch a hand and feel<br>
float a thought<br>
to the rafters<br>
smile at strangers<br>
do not diet<br>
don’t be quiet<br>
eat tomato sauce<br>
do not hold back a tear<br>
drink beer<br>
do not drink and drive<br>
talk less about yourself<br>
talk less<br>
mess up, apologize<br>
eat pie<br>
humble pie<br>
open your eyes<br>
look inside your friends<br>
and ask them how they are<br>
take a trip round the darkest bends<br>
together, tracking the trail<br>
of the wandering star<br>
to as far as the road goes<br>
the ship would sail<br>
the story slows<br>
hits a sandbank<br>
and the phosphorescence<br>
in the water glows<br>
and grows a blanket of silence<br>
in which you can be wrapped<br>
rapapapapap-rapapapap<br>
sometimes be quiet for an hour<br>
sit in the veld and observe<br>
if not ants, birds<br>
if not birds, bats<br>
if not bats, buck<br>
pick up pretty stones<br>
and twisted roots<br>
seed pods and mice skulls<br>
carry them home<br>
arrange them on the sill<br>
trace their outlines<br>
against the days of life<br>
lemonade, cold<br>
tea, slowly<br>
coffee, with a rusk<br>
write with a pen on paper<br>
purchase pencils<br>
postcards to distant friends<br>
travel alone<br>
travel far<br>
travel to the point<br>
where you swivel on your heel<br>
and remember where you come from<br>
who you are<br>
why you came<br>
phone your parents<br>
phone your siblings<br>
phone your school friends<br>
phone your sick friends<br>
phone your friends with children<br>
sometimes, switch off your phone for a week<br>
do not check email<br>
do not use a computer<br>
sleep for twelve hours<br>
three days in a row<br>
until your dreams return<br>
read a thick book<br>
a 1000-page book<br>
a book with difficult words in it<br>
a book with an open ending<br>
Roberto Bolaño’s book<br>
walk around the house<br>
in your underpants<br>
or naked<br>
without drawing the curtains<br>
do push-ups, run<br>
when the wind blows strongly<br>
lean into it<br>
and open your arms like an albatross<br>
burp, fart, shit<br>
pee outside<br>
and especially, next to highways<br>
wipe your bum<br>
with something other than toilet paper<br>
buy the newspaper<br>
even if you don’t read it<br>
support the idea of a poem<br>
write poems, bad or good,<br>
hidden or shown<br>
purchase binoculars, study birds<br>
investigate trees<br>
consider different types of grass<br>
stop by a road-cutting<br>
and look at the layers of rock<br>
picnic, own a thermos<br>
wrap sandwiches in foil<br>
eat peanut butter from the jar<br>
drop it like it’s hot<br>
drink coca cola<br>
when it’s hot<br>
drool on your pillow<br>
dance<br>
laugh<br>
cry<br>
cut the shit<br>
dislike money<br>
donate money<br>
spend money<br>
earn money<br>
look after money<br>
but dislike money<br>
do something you like<br>
if it’s an office job<br>
remember who’s the boss<br>
and who’s in charge<br>
and that you’re the latter<br>
swim in the sea<br>
or in a river<br>
or a farm dam<br>
hold your breath for a long time<br>
open your eyes underwater<br>
float on your back<br>
close your eyes<br>
listen to the sound in your ears<br>
the slow, dark, deathly croak<br>
of your brittle body’s<br>
cooked and cracked<br>
organs and bones<br>
slowly paddle back<br>
to where you can stand<br>
look at the person<br>
waiting there<br>
walk over<br>
kiss her<br>
