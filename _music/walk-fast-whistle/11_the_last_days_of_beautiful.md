title: The last days of beautiful
---

**I.**<br>
in the last days of beautiful<br>
we lick from one another’s<br>
salty eye pans from which<br>
grassy thin trails lead to<br>
other parts of our faces<br>
where the heavier animals<br>
have walked<br>


**II.**<br>
the last days of beautiful<br>
have galloped from far away<br>
and now rest by the valley’s rim<br>
lungs quietly working life<br>
back into stretched limbs<br>
to watch as we lock the door<br>
on our most precious things<br>
one last time<br>


**III.**<br>
it’s really just that<br>
we are one another’s<br>
Google Earth and I can zoom in<br>
to where your contours pixelate<br>
and your dreams are to be seen<br>
with afternoon shadows<br>
stretching across a sandy lick<br>
left behind by a now gone river<br>
a thousand years ago<br>
this invisible kolk<br>
where in a flood drowned sheep<br>
will twirl and swirl<br>
a funny dance with old tyres<br>
acacia thorns, dip cans<br>
and you and your loved ones<br>
and summer ceilings<br>
freshly painted gates<br>
and the rich, strong<br>
smell of open earth, dung, wet<br>
<br>
I have dropped into Street View<br>
and I am holding your hand<br>
not that you could get lost<br>
or I could get lost<br>
but because it is the only<br>
way to know<br>
that we are both here<br>
and feeling our way down<br>
a familiar, lived-in<br>
land burning with light<br>
sunlight, fire, street lights<br>
and a re-adjusted north<br>
telephone pole upon telephone pole<br>
upon telephone pole upon<br>
<br>
This is the last days of beautiful<br>
I say and you say Why don’t you then<br>
climb into this sand dune with me?<br>
so I do, I shut the sand dune behind us<br>
and we pack the word This into a sock-drawer<br>
where it stays with Is and The<br>
Last and Days are set free through<br>
a small window to fly away<br>
to an Ark of their own and Of<br>
is planted in a pot and watered and<br>
Beautiful is laid out on the table<br>
and lightly dressed with something<br>
and then we tuck in<br>
