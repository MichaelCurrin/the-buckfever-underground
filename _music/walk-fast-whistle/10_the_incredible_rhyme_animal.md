title: The incredible rhyme animal
---

if you are the incredible rhyme animal<br>
like chuck d or a honey bee<br>
on a mole hill by the sawmill<br>
or on a thermal on a sunnyday<br>
or a saturday or a monday<br>
like a monkey on a donkey<br>
with a palm frond<br>
as a hat, man<br>
<br>
then the pace changes and the bass picks up<br>
and the bass picks bait from the mouth of the pup<br>
of a polar bear with a fleece for a coat<br>
all afloat in a boat – stick your hands up<br>
for the little mongoose in the pocket of the coat<br>
and the fox in the box with the icefloe mice<br>
the ferret called Merryl and Beryl the hare<br>
and remember our guy with the rhyme and the time<br>
that fishy little slime of a frog on a dime<br>
now’s he croaking a joke about the yoke of a yak<br>
and the sorry little sssss of the serpent’s sis<br>
and the civet’s scat at the back of the batcave<br>
back to the front gave poor otomys<br>
the hippo hippo shake and the<br>
r h i n o c e r o u s<br>
is hard to spell but easy to kill<br>
you can tell by the trail of the unborn horns<br>
there’s a hornbill howling like a baby tonight<br>
like a baby tonight like a baby tonight<br>
for the elephant’s tusk and the musk deer’s musk<br>
and the trophied face and eternal snarl<br>
of a lion on the wall and the horns of hell<br>
of the folding legs of the dagha boy’s death<br>
the panda’s bum on an abalone shell<br>
with dodo drumstick on the breath<br>
and the final spots of a leopard that fell<br>
by the feet of a gun at the soul of a man<br>
<br>
and then<br>
<br>
if you could still be the remaining incredible<br>
invincible rhyme animal<br>
you could go all<br>
stop-start stop-start<br>
like a four-toed sloth<br>
or elephant shrew<br>
or a lonely gnu<br>
in a stew or a broth<br>
on the stove top now<br>
there’s a cow in a pot<br>
on the plot you got sheep<br>
and chickens in a coop<br>
but the rat in the cage<br>
is you in your sleep<br>
