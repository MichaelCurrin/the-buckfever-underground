title: All the loves
---

**I.**<br>
all the loves<br>
of the season are here, behold<br>
<br>
we have to eat our daily mielies<br>
holding them by our hands<br>
spinning the cob under the tips<br>
of our index fingers<br>
like the world<br>
the watermelon slice of world<br>
the fine dust of the carpenter<br>
settling on the shallow sea<br>
of his sweaty skin<br>
his tender wetsuit<br>
of refined wood<br>
lost forest, a lonely pine<br>
<br>
ping<br>
<br>
that’s summer<br>
in the microwave<br>
the re-heated paella<br>
in which the mussels explode<br>
and litter the roof<br>
like assorted pets<br>
of skin and hide<br>
<br>
all the loves<br>
of the season are here<br>
and they hold hands<br>
and sit in a park<br>
as children<br>
and levitate<br>
as leaves<br>
<br>
some of what will come<br>
will be violent and winter<br>
will slow down<br>
the highveld will smell of<br>
electricity and coal<br>
spikes and cold water spit<br>
dead dog on the highway<br>
pigeons cordite muffin wrappers<br>
petrol piss skin<br>
<br>
all the loves<br>
of the season are here<br>
and when spring comes<br>
and the sailboats are hung<br>
in the sky<br>
from them will be shook<br>
fresh beers and party hats<br>
wedding vows and choruses<br>
splits of laughter<br>
and palms slapping<br>
on a swimming pool<br>
and then<br>
<br>
all the loves<br>
of the season shall hum<br>
and gather their smiles and then<br>
hold you up and say:<br>
<br>
we are all the loves<br>
<br>


**II.**<br>
the most sensible thing to do<br>
with all the loves is to<br>
write them out a hundred<br>
thousand times on the inside<br>
of paper-thin sharp<br>
bird skulls and walnut shells<br>
the walls of the ruins of<br>
farmhouses around which<br>
lie scattered shards of pottery<br>
and plates, prickly pears and<br>
dried out pigeon wings<br>
and recite all the names<br>
of all the loves<br>
silently in your sleep<br>
in a sleeping bag under the stars<br>
in a cave where the last coals<br>
dance like the black spots<br>
of a genet or a civet<br>
or a black-footed cat<br>
across your docked hip<br>
and back and neck<br>
and lips mouthing<br>
the last loves<br>
imperceptibly moving leaves<br>
just breathing, just twirling the batons<br>
of their stems from the branch<br>
on their tree<br>
in its place<br>
around which the last loves<br>
gather in a kind of wild<br>
race a formula one<br>
with no track and no start<br>
no finish and no rules<br>
no winner and no last<br>
just a chair on a porch<br>
empty but warm:<br>
yours<br>


**III.**<br>
all the loves swim<br>
and leave their clothes on the beach<br>
hoist their children to their shoulders<br>
as they walk back to their cars<br>
and call their dogs<br>
<br>
all the loves sit<br>
around a table without words<br>
moulding their food with<br>
their tongues into<br>
small enough<br>
balls<br>
<br>
the loves under the tree<br>
on the summer lawn<br>
look up<br>
to where the crested barbet’s<br>
swallowed alarm clock<br>
shatters the canopy<br>
and the bark into a gazillion<br>
dots and bytes<br>
<br>
all the little loves are<br>
on the wall of the kraal<br>
and their small feet<br>
dangle from their<br>
reverse antelope knees<br>
as they watch<br>
a deft hand digging deep<br>
into a cow to slide<br>
a gasping calf wrapped<br>
in plastic slimo-cellophane<br>
into the sun of life<br>
<br>
the weary loves stop<br>
at the top of the hill<br>
and look back to where<br>
more are still pushing<br>
their wheelbarrows full<br>
of water and children<br>
bags of maize flour<br>
sugar and tea and soap<br>
and all around the rutted<br>
dirt ribbons of road<br>
of goats and groves<br>
of banana and fields<br>
of cassava and cashew<br>
nut trees and coconuts<br>
they pause to wipe<br>
the sweat from another hour<br>
<br>
and all the loves<br>
gathered around the hole<br>
in the ground have had<br>
already now<br>
the cool of the church<br>
steamed from their suits<br>
and their dresses and hats<br>
as they return<br>
a hymn to the sky<br>

### IV.

all the loves slowly<br>
set fire to their insides/ ideas<br>
the bar is a palace<br>
the walls are lined<br>
with the heads and horns<br>
of antelope shot<br>
at daybreak nearby<br>
<br>
all the loves twirl<br>
with the pale-winged starlings<br>
around the shepherd’s tree<br>
at the mouth of the kloof<br>
where a traitor was shot<br>
a century ago<br>
<br>
all the loves lift stones<br>
and disarm scorpions<br>
with a quick pinch<br>
and eat them<br>
<br>
all the loves are going<br>
to town on friday<br>
to buy a new shoe<br>
to take a pocket<br>
of potatoes<br>
to a grandmother<br>
wearing glasses<br>
made in 1962<br>
<br>
all the loves are waiting<br>
to catch the bus back<br>
with broken suitcases<br>
and bulging bags<br>
the bus back<br>
to where the backs of friends<br>
are pulled up at the stove<br>
stirring a pot of nothing<br>
to eat with no-one<br>
at nowhere<br>
<br>
all the loves thrill<br>
all the loves can tear us apart<br>
all the loves ride on<br>
all the loves rock and roll<br>
all the loves can live as one<br>
<br>
all the loves<br>
