title: Love in a time of visas
---

you’re seeing the bosphorus in the distance, from here I can see the cable cars<br>
(two things on the same line, but never at the same station)<br>
we can both see mosques, or at least, if I was standing on the roof I could<br>
you’re cooking something in the kitchen, I’m spinning around on an office chair<br>
there’s a tiny delay, when we laugh it becomes irrelevant<br>
<br>
I’m trying to let a twenty minute phone call tell me something new about you<br>
trying to let that hug you send me crunch my bones, pretending the plastic of the phone<br>
is the warm curve of your face that fits like a favourite hat<br>
the kind of hat you’ll climb back up a mountain for,<br>
knowing that it’s kept you warm before<br>
and there’s no reason to let it go just like that<br>
<br>
that email you sent me about full moon<br>
was like a brainscan spelled out in english<br>
I wish I was a psychopath, I mean a homeopath, I mean,<br>
I wish I had telepathic powers, so I can make you do things with your hands<br>
or control about an inch of your skin, make it glow in the dark, just a bit<br>
like an indiglo watch, a blinking cellphone charger, uv strips on a jogger<br>
<br>
I wish it was the end of july already,<br>
so I can rub a rough thumb over your eyebrows<br>
and take you to a room somewhere<br>
where we can talk and unpack and shower<br>
and put our steaming limbs together,<br>
melting the sheets as if it was snow<br>
in the thin quiet air of nepal<br>
<br>
then I can put my ear to yours<br>
and download enough mp3s for years of listening pleasure<br>
<br>
and tonight, what i remember is nothing<br>
but the blue in your eyes turning green<br>
like a fish<br>
jumping in and out of water<br>
as the sheets in my bed flap<br>
from darkness to heaven<br>
<br>
tonight’s the night<br>
that i feel the warmth of your face<br>
like a gust from the warm wind mulling<br>
around now for hours and hours<br>
like the weather is one of your powers<br>
<br>
and even if all i have to show for it is<br>
backpain<br>
and a sense of something incomplete<br>
when i go through my daily prayer<br>
of car eat work shit sleep<br>
<br>
and even if all i need to know<br>
is that when i play a song i like<br>
you’re somewhere in it<br>
laughing<br>
like rubbish removal is a service<br>
for clowns<br>
doing black humour<br>
<br>
and you’re directing aeroplanes again<br>
to take off and to land<br>
when you dance like a madman<br>
and sing in a band<br>
<br>
and my heart is a leather handle,<br>
pulling with the tides<br>
of yours hitching rides<br>
with the freedom in the sand<br>
<br>
my teeth are aching for peppermint chocolate<br>
and lion’s breath in the morning<br>
by that river,<br>
you remember<br>
<br>
because tonight,<br>
i watched a movie alone<br>
together with other people<br>
and the moon<br>
was just hanging there<br>
like a church<br>
without a steeple<br>
