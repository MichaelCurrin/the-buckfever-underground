title: All You Need In Life Is A Soul
---

all you need in life is a soul<br>
and i lost mine today<br>
at the supermarket<br>
as i was reaching for a sixpack<br>
of yoghurt in the frozen food alley<br>
it slipped through the shelves<br>
i saw it go<br>
i complained to the manager<br>
he said sorry sir no refunds<br>
and still had the nerve<br>
to slap me 14% vat<br>
on top of that<br>
for my half full basket<br>
of stuff to eat<br>
<br>
yes all you need in life is a soul<br>
and if you lose it to a girl<br>
or to music or scenery<br>
you shouldn’t expect to get it back<br>
not just like that<br>
unless you don’t mind it being<br>
shot full of holes<br>
tossed out a window<br>
on a dirt road in the noorsveld<br>
or just generally<br>
lost, empty, wrung out, hollow,<br>
sad, wandering the afternoon<br>
like a headless guinea fowl<br>
whose number is kept<br>
by a sharp civet<br>
<br>
yes all you need in life is a soul<br>
and i wish i could play guitar properly<br>
then i’ll show you how one can bleed<br>
on the inside of your shirt<br>
how your hunched up<br>
body can unbutton and break<br>
loose into the numbness<br>
with faith blinded by gin<br>
on the one side<br>
the other side a gun a best friend<br>
who just doesn’t care<br>
what you do<br>
who you are<br>
just that<br>
you are there<br>
