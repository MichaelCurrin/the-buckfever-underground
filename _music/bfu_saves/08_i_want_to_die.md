title: Want To Die On A Tuesday Afternoon
---

i want to die, i want to die<br>
i want to die without a wife<br>
or at least without one that didn’t love me<br>
so i can be free of all the mourning,<br>
the bitterness and the black, all the tears & kak<br>
<br>
i want to die wearing these same shoes<br>
& my favourite t-shirt too<br>
i don’t wanna kill myself<br>
i’d rather let someone else<br>
20 000 people can’t be wrong<br>
<br>
i want to die on a tuesday afternoon<br>
on a busy sidewalk or maybe<br>
a pretty park in town, so the bergies<br>
or tannies, skollies or the cops,<br>
can stop by and stare for a while<br>
until the blood runs dry<br>
<br>
i want to die towards the end of the year<br>
in december, or in november<br>
so i won’t lose that much on my subscriptions<br>
to die burger and insig and DSTV<br>
and any case then by christmas<br>
all can be forgotten so the new year<br>
could be happy again<br>
<br>
i want to die on a tuesday afternoon<br>
just after i’ve returned all my overdue<br>
videos and library books – paying all my<br>
fines happily while ignoring those<br>
traffic department summonses<br>
knowing that video stores and libraries are<br>
good for man, and traffic cops are not<br>
<br>
yes and i want to die on a cool<br>
& cloudy day, so my body won’t<br>
swell up and rot and stink that much<br>
and maybe at about half past three<br>
so the coroners and the crime reporters<br>
can make all their deadlines<br>
and be home at eight for dinner<br>
with their wives and families<br>
<br>
yes i want to die without too much hassle alright<br>
you can cremate me or make me into compost<br>
or king pies or that stuff you put in potholes<br>
or whatever but i want to die yes i want to die<br>
late in the year at about half past three in a cool spot in a quiet park<br>
<br>
yes i want to die yes i want to die<br>
i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die<br>
on a tuesday afternoon<br>
please<br>
<br>
