title: Deathland

**I.**<br>
in deathland i draw the curtains<br>
of the bullet-blown windows<br>
and the furtherdown uncertains<br>
the blacked breeze ‘n’ blows<br>
grow the skin of the nation tight<br>
across a skull of men and might<br>
there’s hooting now and hollers<br>
roving dogs burning dollars<br>
the apocalyptic leaves<br>
of an economy of mean<br>
and a gunshot cracking the eaves<br>
on the eve of a murderer seen<br>
slinking across television screens<br>
amidst the screams of fawning teens<br>
and the burst of a sickly spleen<br>
of all our insides<br>
of all our souls<br>
for the stink of the hides<br>
crackling over the coals<br>
in the backyard by the pool<br>
by the neighbourhoods of our hearts<br>
is all crazy, all fool<br>
all walk on, all bit-part<br>
and instead of stopping<br>
we keep on starting<br>
the engine and the fireblade<br>
the military cavalcade<br>
of the hatemachine and smoke<br>
we hold too dear to die<br>
the choke the fade the joke<br>
the lie the past the lie<br>
shopping shitting shopping<br>
raping rapping raping<br>
by the mall of carnage<br>
by the crater of misunderstand<br>
at the ruins of the wreckage<br>
outside the window<br>
of deathland<br>


**II.**<br>
i draw the blanket of bones to my chin<br>
some my own, some of kin<br>
and i close my eyes<br>
in deathland<br>
<br>
the burning house is a light to some<br>
moths come to sacrifice<br>
our smiles and artifice<br>
our silence<br>
<br>
with a spade in hand and a bent back<br>
sweat dripping down<br>
into the solid ground<br>
the deepening hole<br>
<br>
when the clock lacks hands<br>
and time is a shrill bird<br>
in the parched land<br>
of silver and sin<br>
<br>
the animals roam in packs<br>
by the seams of the city<br>
smelling us out<br>
running<br>
<br>
the child is alone<br>
on a spinning wheel<br>
in a park with no gate<br>
no fence<br>
<br>
the wind saws an afternoon<br>
in two<br>
the sun drills a night<br>
in half<br>
<br>
the dream is a hurricane<br>
the hurricane is here<br>
here is a bedroom<br>
with no walls<br>
<br>
in a place with a new name<br>
a place of black oil<br>
and gas<br>
and forget<br>
<br>
the forefathers have risen<br>
the mothers of the nation<br>
are awake<br>
in the hills<br>
<br>
and they look down upon<br>
our sleeping faces<br>
our blanket of bones<br>
in deathland<br>


**III.**<br>
i dream the dreams of the blind<br>
who might have seen as a child<br>
so only recall rocks and blood<br>
tree and dog shapes, mud<br>
the rest is sound<br>
and textures<br>
and the gravity pulling<br>
at the lip of a cliff<br>
towards the hollow depths<br>
of deathland<br>
<br>
i dream the dreams of the unborn<br>
of the lost, the forlorn<br>
a gate is left open and i roll<br>
down a highway black as coal<br>
a tumbleweed on fire<br>
the river of life<br>
streaming from my mouth<br>
north to south<br>
east to west the breadth<br>
of deathland<br>
<br>
i dream the dreams of the dead<br>
there is nothing left to dread<br>
the harbour is full of wrecks<br>
just scarecrows left on deck<br>
to wave goodbye<br>
to the gathering dark<br>
where the starlings form a painting<br>
a second coming<br>
in the sky<br>
above deathland<br>


**IV.**<br>
the boatmen of the world<br>
have been left without<br>
a sea to sail upon<br>
and now ply their trade<br>
on sharp-pointed pirogues<br>
in the narrow canals<br>
of our veins<br>
<br>
the shepherds of the land<br>
sheepless since sunday<br>
are now calling in vain<br>
in the echoing spelunk<br>
of our vulture-picked-clean<br>
chest of a church<br>
where the last<br>
of the flock<br>
on the pulpit<br>
has turned and left<br>
an exit wound<br>
<br>
the car guards of the city<br>
have but oxwagons to watch<br>
in the wrong little epoch<br>
of reflective loin-cloths<br>
and language too deeply imbued<br>
by symbolism and shades<br>
to be understood<br>
by the lady<br>
with the gold rings<br>
and gucci<br>
<br>
the funeral undertakers however<br>
have a fun time<br>
as they count<br>
the neatly dug rectangles<br>
in the eternal city lodge<br>
of our funny fucking lives<br>
in deathland<br>
