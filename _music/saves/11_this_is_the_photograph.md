title: This Is The Photograph I Was Meaning To Take
---

this is the photograph i was meaning to take when you turned around on the terminal floor when you hung up the phone hurled it in the snow when you whispered when you cried when you opened your eyes like the door of a car when you spilled out over me in blue brown black and blonde when you sat down to type a long letter on the computer in your house with capital letters and full stops soul and meaning humour exclamation marks paper cuts and loose bits of dry skin the epidermis of wasted time vitamin d sunscreen and sweat<br>
<br>
this is the photograph i was meaning to take when we hurtled through stations fell asleep in each other’s arms got drunk rated beers shook black pebbles in our hands on the shore of a lake pissed acid from extra sour red cocktails drove on highways raced through the caprivi strip braaied on a balcony slept in tents slipped on ice ate all we could poured wine down the red saucers of sunsets went to music festivals house parties bars pubs clubs diners restaurants food shacks coffee shops markets movies mountain drive incheon the red dragon the strand at dawn with waves breaking sharkless and cold into the continents of our bodies motor cars plastic blue bins creosote poles shingle shells the sand the city all year-rings nodes twigs branches knots in our fleeting floodlit lives as saplings trees shrubs in the forest the garden the harsh velvet veld of this place<br>

this is the photograph i was meaning to take when i ran out of film out of batteries out of power ripped a hole to let in the light to run fire through the film shots of morning bottled-up grainy grey private thoughts deceit maybe the dogs of comfort crows’ beaks claws slices of hot and cold iron filings racing through magnetic wheatfields trampling the black and white grenades remote controlled detonations filed prenatally in the tight plastic silos of my dimly beating caltex oiltincan joke for a heartbrainribcagehipcup begging for bones bodytrap passing through the eye of the world’s needle<br>
