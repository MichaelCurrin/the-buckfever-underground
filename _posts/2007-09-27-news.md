We've had lekker gigs in Stellenbosch, Matjiesfontein and Durbanville and we're now looking forward to the final Capeside SAVES launch at the Armchair on the 2nd. It's gonna be a lekker one, so come.

Good news for our fans across the waters (and in Mali) is that you can now order SAVES through CD Baby It really is easy - click on the link and it should take you straight to the page where you can order SAVES from. It costs US $12, 97. You can also now download all the tracks from SAVES as well as our earlier albums, Jou Medemens Is Dood and TAFL - Teaching Afrikaans As A Foreign Language from Rhythm Records. It costs just R7 per song. SAVES should also soon be in shops nationwide and we will publish a list of shops here asap so you can find it easily.
