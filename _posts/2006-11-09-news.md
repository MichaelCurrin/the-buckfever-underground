Plenty of good news:

As far as we know, Stephen is alive and well in Brazil. If you see him along the way, give him a beer. Gil has ditched that other CD cover design we did the shoot for and is now coming up with some awesome stuff in his factory of dreams on top of the Armchair. Next door, Righard is churning out kiff posters. Jon sent word from Joburg that our album is finally mastered, so things are finally sort of happening.

Onthou, 'Jou Medemens Is Dood' is weer beskikbaar. Die nuwe Ons Klyntji (November 2006) is ook nou beskikbaar. It contains extracts from Stephen's Brazilian diary. Bestel nou van Produkte.

You can read one of Steve's emails from Brazil here.
