Thanks to Misha and Carel at Oppikoppi, who managed to find us a spot on the Oppikoppi Easter line-up in the nick of time. Soet slaap sonder sonde, sien julle daar op die 14de, na sononder, iewers onder 'n grasdak. Die eerste rondte is op ons.

We depart on The I Shot A Muishond In Gauteng Just To Watch Him Die Tour tomorrow. Check back here in a couple of weeks, we'll stick some pics up.
