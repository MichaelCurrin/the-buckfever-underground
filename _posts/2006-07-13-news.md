Well, well. Here we are. Winter. Real jobs. Denial.

Our friends Inge Prins and Charles Badenhorst & Diek Grobler have made some music videos for us. Inge did a great cell-phone snowscape for 'This Is The Photograph I Was Meaning To Take' and Charles & Diek did some great animation for 'Ek & Jy'. We love them and thank them for it. We might show you some of it on this site soon.

Album? What album?

Check [gigs]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/shows.md %}) once in a while - Toast & Righard are playing at the Armchair Lyric Festival on the 1st and 2nd of August.
