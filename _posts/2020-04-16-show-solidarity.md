We are showing our solidarity to people affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and food shortages. We have donated to the **Fighting For Water Justice Coalition** and encourage you to do the same.

They are a community-based organisation which is providing relief for people in the **Witzenberg municipality** - an agricultural region in the Western Cape that is an hour and a half's drive from Cape Town. 

They are providing **meals** and **public education** in the these towns: 

- Tulbagh
- Bella Vista
- Pine Valley
- Montana
- Prince Alfred Hamlet.
