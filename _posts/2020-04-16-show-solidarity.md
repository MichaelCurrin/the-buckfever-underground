We are showing our solidarity to people affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and food shortages. We have donated to the **Fighting For Water Justice Coalition** and encourage you to do the same.

They are a community-based organisation and are providing relief for people in the **Witzenberg** area in the Western Cape - an agricultural region an hour and a half's drive from Cape Town on Route 62. They are providing **meals** and **public education** in the following towns: Tulbagh, Bella Vista, Pine Valley, Montana and Prince Alfred Hamlet.
