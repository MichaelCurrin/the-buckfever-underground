Sometimes you listen to Chris Letcher's 'Spectroscope' for five hours non-stop. And that's a good thing. There's plenty to report. For example, Timothy Gabb has made us a really lekker video for the track [Red-Winged Starlings](https://vimeo.com/64368373) off Verkeerdevlei. You can see it here: Red-Winged Starlings video (mind the pigeons... it's all vibe!)

Gil has also brought out a very special new EP called All The Things. And yes, Chris Letcher plays on it! George Marchinskowski is there! Download it here: [All The Things](http://gilhockman.bandcamp.com/album/all-the-things).

While we're at it, here are links to some of our other recent-ish projects and their output. Jon has another band called [Kiterider](https://kiterider.bandcamp.com/).

And then there's also Simply Dead, which is Toast and Jon and Jane: [Simply Dead](http://simplydead.co.za/) (_update: link no longer valid_).

Gigs are in the pipeline, plans are afoot, songs are being written. Even the Southern Kings are winning.
