title: Fujifilm Instax photos - Laaste Dae-toer
---

On our [2 week tour]({% link _shows/2019-april-tour.md %}) in April 2019, we experienced so many great views, quirky venues and warm people. And we captured every day in photos.

A big thank you to [Fujifilm SA](https://www.myfujifilm.co.za/) for lending us an Instax film camera.
