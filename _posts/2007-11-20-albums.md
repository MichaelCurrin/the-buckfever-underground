Our guitarist Righard is busy making us some pretty amazing animated videos for a couple of our tunes. Here are some rough pieces from the storyboard for 'Die Wortel Van Kwaad'.

In further, related news, some of our songs will shortly appear on a number of compilation CDs. Keep an eye open for the CD released by the Mail&Guardian sometime. Also, an underground compilation from Joburg and the crew at isolation.tv and friends called Pavement Special (monitor https://pavementspecial.com/ - *UPDATE: link broken*) is due out this month and we have some tracks on that. It doesn't stop though: Boeke-Insig mag ook dalk in Desember 'n CD he en ons kan daar op ook wees. Dan, wat definitief 'n feit is, is dat die nuwe Ons Klyntji zine tans beskikbaar en twee van ons songs is op die great 22-track CD getiteld 'Ons Kerk Se Mense' wat daarmee saamkom. Drikus van Trike het dit compile en ander acts sluit in Nul, Paul Riekert, Insek, Bacchus Nel, Bittervrug en baie meer. Check dit, koop dit, geniet dit. Dis Kersvrees.
