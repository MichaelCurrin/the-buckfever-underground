Much has happened. Our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _shows/2013_oct_nov.md %}">Oct-Nov 2013 tour</a> was a smash hit! We even made money! We sold all of the t-shirts!

Then we recorded for a weekend with Tim Rankin and now we've got most of a new album sorted. Currently doing the odds and ends. In February we did a couple of lekker gigs courtesy of Brian Sterley at Connecting Cities - we saw Milnerton! We saw Bellville! Breathless stuff. Soon, we play with Darkroom Contemporary. See <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/shows.md %}">gigs</a> for all the details.

New album should hopefully be done and ready for launch mid-2014. Hold your horses by the kraal. Thanks.
