We've been recording a number of our gigs on Gil's MD player and decided that our gig at The Hidden Cellar (Stellenbosch) on the 25th of June sounded so nice that we'd like to see it live a bit wider than the 15 people who attended the show. Btw, if you're one of those 15, please email us. It's a 7-track CD with more than an hour of music. Check back soon for full tracklisting and lyrics. You can buy it already or check the lyrics.
