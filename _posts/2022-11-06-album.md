Our new album, Voortvlugtend, is actually an old album recorded back in November 2013, but, it took us some time to get it out and ready! Better late than never, right…

It features the full 5-member band line-up of that era: Gilad Hockman, Jon Savage, Righard Kapp, Toast Coetzer and Stephen Timm.

You can download it from Bandcamp [here](https://buckfeverunderground.bandcamp.com/album/voortvlugtend) or email us on <info@toastcoetzer.com> if you’d like to order a CD-R copy. The album is also available on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/64CsQDGZFx0ejzIy8VFaI9), [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/za/artist/the-buckfever-underground/265957199), [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nErN4c_INcKwAfEwxtjHtrbAFoV-rRAdo), [Deezer](https://www.deezer.com/en/artist/566238) and other streaming and download services.
