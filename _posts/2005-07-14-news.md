We spent three days (9th-11th) in Sibebe Studios in Derry Street, Vredehoek with Tara Fataar at the console. We recorded 12 tracks, mostly long bastards, but a couple of pop ditties inbetween. There's some kiddie-punk, 80s synth, well-disguised hip hop, John Lennon, kletzmer-music, groove, noise, thud, violin and even some backing vocals. It's pretty scary. But don't worry, there's not a happy song in there. Here are some photos.
