Four launch gigs have been confirmed in the Western Cape for September and early October - visit gigs for all the details, venues, booking numbers and so on. We hope to sort some Gauteng gigs for later in October or November, but then again, people have been hoping for peace in the Middle East for a very, very long time. So hold onto your seat belts. There are also new reviews and an interview at <a href="{% link _pages/press.md %}">Press</a>. The new album, Limbs Gone Batty (I almost typed Natty, which would've been natty indeed), is now available for digital download at [Rhythm Records](http://www.rhythmrecords.co.za/store/viewAlbum.asp?idAlbum=536) (_Update: website no longer valid_). In other news, Caster Semenya rocks the party. And my car battery is flat. Again. Kan iemand dalk 'n God bel? En vir hom se ons het hom nodig?
