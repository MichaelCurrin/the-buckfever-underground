- **Beeld / Die Burger** Augustus 2009. Danie Marais wrote a lekker review of our live album, comparing the musos to "explorers of old".
- [Mail & Guardian](http://www.mg.co.za/article/2009-07-06-splintering-jewel) July 2009. Lloyd Gedye did a combo-review of Limbs Gone Batty, as well as Righard Kapp's solo album Strung Like A Compound Eye and Stephen Timm's second electronic album under his Myrid Ambre moniker.
- **iafrica.com** June 2009. Nils van der Linden interviewed Toast in the lead-up to the release of Limbs Gone Batty. The result? Something like: "The 'vibe' of a time and place can glue the emotion in place just fine." Say what?
