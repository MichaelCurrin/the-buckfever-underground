Toast Coezter is one of our country’s finest travel writers. In his band Buckfever Underground, he has one of the best vehicles to mumble Breyten-Breytenbach-like sound-poems, half in Afrikaans, half in English, accompanied on BU’s first full-length album, Saves (self-released), by a bassist who sounds like Peter Hook circa Joy Division, a guitarist reminding me of Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore, a meandering organ like Jerry Harrison’s in the Modern Lovers and a drummer reminiscent of Velvet Underground’s Moe Tucker. This is truly original, experimental art rock that gives Bok van Blerk stereotypes about Afrikaans music the snotklap it deserves. – Charles Leonard.
