I was first introduced to The Buckfever Underground at Rhodes (University). The came across as some sort of alternative novelty band, with a chaotic collection of musicians dressed in campus workman’s overalls providing backdrops for Toast Coetzer’s reflective poetry. They have come a long way since then. The addition of guitar-magician Righard Kapp elevates the joyful noise they make to new plateaus. Buckfever seems more like a real band now. It’s the (mainly Afrikaans) poetry delivered in Toast Coetzer’s melancholy drone that makes them unique, but this time they’ve coupled it with a higher level of musical complexity. Score: 80%.
