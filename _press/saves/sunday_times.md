With soundscapes as bleak as the Karoo farmstead frontman Toast Coetzer calls home, The Buckfever Underground release their first full-length album after almost a decade of sporadic live appearances and EPs. Musically, this is BU’s most refined effort, reminiscent of bands such as Arab Strap and early God Speed You Black Emperor. Toast’s spoken lyrics are cynical, drearily irreverent lamentations on living in South Africa, and for that alone this record is worth a listen.
