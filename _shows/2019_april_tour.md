Our band tour is planned for 12 to 24 April 2019. We are playing shows every day and are using this opportunity to launch our new album.

We're playing across the country including at PE and Knysna, on our way to Joburg and back. We wind up the tour close to home, playing in Stellenbosch and finally at Alma Cafe in Cape Town.
