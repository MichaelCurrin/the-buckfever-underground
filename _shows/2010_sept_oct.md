Three shows.

### Sat 25th Sept

Matjiesfontein - Show & Tell event (RIP David Rawdon) in the centre of the known universe not including Northam. Yes, the full Buckfever clan will be in attendance. Also in the mix are our Joburg friends, Jaco + Z-Dog. We'll play sometime Saturday night.

Show & Tell is a mini-festival created by the people who attend. To attend, you simply need to come show something. Your entrance fee is your accommodation in the town for the weekend or night or two or whatnot. Expect everything from rare films to bands to people doing wagon wheels while on gin and tonic. With the recent passing of the "mayor" of Matjies, David Rawdon, come join in the radness and let's make it a weekend David would've wanted us all to have.

### Wed 29th Sept

Stellenbosch, Hidden Cellar. 8 pm sharp, R50 at the door gets you three acts, no, four: Gilad Hockman (gone solo!), Alex Omega (Stb's biggest underground secret, so underground that it would be a rare hipster to have heard of him), Jaco + Z-Dog (be warned, be warned, be warned) and The Buckfever Underground. Address: Above Die Akker, Dorp Street, Stb. You know where it is...

### Fri 1st Oct

Cape Town, Gatta Patat Teaterkafee. Come at 7 pm if you'd like to dine, the show starts at 8 pm sharp, R80 a ticket gets you four acts again, as above: Gilad Hockman, Alex Omega, Jaco + Z-Dog and The Buckfever Underground. Address: corner of Longmarket and Parliament streets. The food is good, so come early - our show here last year was sold out, so book asap.
