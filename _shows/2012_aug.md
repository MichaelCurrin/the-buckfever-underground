Four shows around South Africa.

### Tue 7th

The Bioscope, Johannesburg. We played with the awesome Brown Spiders. It was so damn cold that night (it had snowed in Joburg earlier that day) - thanks to all who came out.

### Friday 10th

Bruilof Stage, Oppikoppi, Northam. Our fourth (or fifth?) time to take the stage at Oppikoppi, the place of the original birth of our brains. We do love that place. Shot to Carel and Retha and Misha and Tess and Boors and all the sound dudes and the mad folk and the proud folk and the dust and the thorns and even Clive E Smith who pissed in my tent. Favourite other gigs of the weekend: Taleswapper, Brendon Shields, Matthew van der Want, Gert Vlok Nel, The Brother Moves On, Eagles of Death Metal, Peachy Keen and Diplo.

### Fri-Sat 24th-25th

The Fugard Theatre, Cape Town. Album launch for Verkeerdevlei. With sets by Gil, Righard, Stephen and Simply Dead. Also guesting: Jacob Petrus van Schalkwyk.
