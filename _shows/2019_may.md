Fresh from our nationwide tour, we're treating Cape Town to a set of tunes and wordscapes at [The Gin Bar](http://www.theginbar.co.za/) in Cape Town on 10 May.

Show starts at 8 pm sharp, but join us earlier for a drink or two in this legendary Cape Town spot - just the place to weasel into the weekend. R50 at the door. New double disc live album 'Last Days of Beautiful' on sale for R200.
