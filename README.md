# The Buckfever Underground
> Static site content for a South African band that performs poetry with improvised music

_Author: [Michael Currin](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin) (web developer and band member)_.

The project uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to build a static website for The Buckfever Underground. The band's homepage is [thebuckfeverunderground.co.za](http://thebuckfeverunderground.co.za/) - this is created from the `master` branch and updated via FTP. The site is also deployed on a staging environment hosted as a [Github Pages site](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/the-buckfever-underground/), using the `gh-pages` branch (since `develop` cannot be selected to build from).

The rights to the content of this remain with band or the original creators (including reviewers and photographers).

Inspiration for some layout of the site comes from [Sample Band Sites](https://bandzoogle.com/sample-band-sites).
