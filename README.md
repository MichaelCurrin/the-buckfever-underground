A static website for _The Buckfever Underground_. The band's homepage is [thebuckfeverunderground.co.za](https://thebuckfeverunderground.co.za/) - this is created from the `master` branch and updated via FTP.

The rights to the content of this remain with band or the original creators (including reviewers and photographers).

Inspiration for some layout of the site comes from [Sample Band Sites](https://bandzoogle.com/sample-band-sites).
