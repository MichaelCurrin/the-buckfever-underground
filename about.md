The BuckFever Underground are an alternative South African band which has been performing poetry to improvised music since 1998.

Toast Coetzer leads the band with his English and Afrikaans poetry. In its current form, the band includes Stephen Timm on drums and Michael Currin on electric guitar.

Experimental ambient soundscapes from a lot of tracks are influenced by post rock and prog bands and often sounds like the Doors, Pink Floyd, Explosions in the Sky or Tool.

We play in bars, festivals and the lounges of fans. We have a CDs and clothing for sale.
