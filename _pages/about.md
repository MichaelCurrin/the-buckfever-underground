The Buckfever Underground is a South African spoken-word band. We play free-form improvised jazz-rock / post-rock. We perform in bars, art festivals and the lounges of homes.

## The name

What does it mean? To have the "buckfever" describes the condition of a hunter on his first deer hunt - nervous and jumpy. And since we are not mainstream - we are "underground".
