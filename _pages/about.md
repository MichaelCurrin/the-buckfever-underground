The Buckfever Underground is a South African spoken-word band that plays free-form improvised jazz-rock / post-rock. We perform poetry in English and Afrikaans with experimental music.

We tour yearly - throughout the Western Cape and sometimes across the country. We enjoy playing at bars, homes and arts festivals.

## History

The Buckfever Underground has been around since 1998 when then students [Toast Coetzer](#toast-coetzer) (vocals, lyrics) and Gilad Hockman (bass) started the band in Grahamstown. Jon Savage (keyboard) soon joined with [Stephen Timm](#stephen-timm) (drums) and Righard Kapp (guitar) joining after the band had relocated to Cape Town in the early 2000s.
