We are the BuckFever Underground - an alternative South African band which has been performing poetry with improvised music since 1998. We enjoy playing in bars, at writing and music festivals and especially home lounges.

Toast Coetzer is the frontman, writing and performing poetry in English and Afrikaans. In its current form, the band includes Stephen Timm on drums and Michael Currin on electric guitar. Michael takes inspiration for his experimental ambient soundscapes from bands like the Doors, Pink Floyd, Explosions in the Sky and Tool.
