The Buckfever Underground is a South African spoken-word band, who play free-form improvised jazz-rock. We formed in 1998 and we are still going strong, playing in bars, writer and music festivals and especially lounges of fans.


## The name

What does it mean? To have the "buckfever" describes the condition of a hunter on his first deer hunt - nervous and jumpy. And since we are not mainstream - we are "underground".


## Members

In its current form, the band includes 3 members:

### Vocals

Founding member and core of band, [Toast Coetzer](http://www.toastcoetzer.com/) writes and performs his poetry in both English and Afrikaans. Read more on his [Afrikaans Wikipedia page](https://af.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toast_Coetzer).

### Drums

A longstanding member of the band, Stephen Timm plays the drums, sometimes keys and has occasional brings out the percussion set of bells and shakers.

### Guitar

Michael Currin plays electric guitar and sometimes acoustic guitar. He joined in 2016 to fill in for a few shows but soon became an official member of the band, playing shows and tours.

Michael takes inspiration for his experimental ambient soundscapes from bands like the Doors, Pink Floyd, Explosions in the Sky and Tool.
